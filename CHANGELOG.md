# Changelog

All notable changes to html-to-markdown will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.22.3] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- **Python**: Exposed `skip_images` option in `ConversionOptions` API, including type stub files (.pyi) for proper type checking support (issue #183)
- **Elixir**: Added `skip_images` option to `HtmlToMarkdown.Options` module (was completely missing from Elixir binding)
- **Core**: Fixed `<br>` tags being output literally in table cells instead of converting to proper Markdown line breaks. Table cell paragraph and div separators now respect `newline_style` option (issue #184)

## [2.22.2] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- **Ruby gem standalone build** - Fixed Ruby gem failing to build when installed from RubyGems. Removed `lints.workspace = true` (which requires workspace context) and added inline lint configuration. This resolves issue #181.
- **Ruby gem version pinning** - Changed `html-to-markdown-rs` dependency from loose semver (`"2.x.x"`) to exact pin (`"=2.22.2"`) to prevent older gems from pulling incompatible newer crate versions.
- **Version sync script** - Updated `sync_versions.py` to preserve exact version pin prefix (`=`) when syncing Ruby gem dependencies.

## [2.22.1] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- **Java Maven Central publishing** - Fixed Maven Central deployment by adding proper `publish` profile with `central-publishing-maven-plugin` configuration. The plugin is now correctly activated with `-Ppublish` flag and uses `ossrh` server credentials.
- **Java Spotless formatting** - Updated google-java-format to 1.28.0 for Java 25 compatibility.

## [2.22.0] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- **C FFI visitor implementation** - Fixed `html_to_markdown_convert_with_visitor` to properly use the visitor handle during conversion instead of discarding it. Previously the visitor was created but the plain `convert()` function was called instead of `convert_with_visitor()`.
- **C# visitor callbacks** - P/Invoke bindings now correctly invoke visitor callbacks during HTML-to-Markdown conversion (42/42 tests passing).
- **Go visitor callbacks** - Removed regex-based post-processing workaround; Go bindings now use real FFI visitor callbacks with proper struct field ordering.
- **PHP visitor callbacks** - Wired up `PhpVisitorBridge` to pass visitor to Rust core instead of ignoring the visitor parameter.
- **Java visitor callbacks** - Added Panama FFI upcall stubs for all 38 visitor callbacks, enabling full visitor pattern support (95/95 tests passing).

### Added

- **Java `VisitorCallbackFactory`** - New class that creates Panama FFI upcall stubs for visitor callbacks, enabling Java code to receive callbacks from the Rust core during conversion.
- **Java `HtmlToMarkdown.convertWithVisitor()`** - Public API method for converting HTML with a custom visitor implementation.

## [2.21.1] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- **Serde serialization support for ConversionOptions** - Added `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits to `ConversionOptions`, `PreprocessingOptions`, and all related structs. Enables JSON serialization/deserialization with camelCase field naming and lowercase string enum representations.

### Changed

- **Major refactor: Complete Phase 1 modular architecture** - Restructured core converter into modular handler components:
  - Extracted block element handlers (block-level HTML elements)
  - Extracted inline element handlers (2,363 lines of focused code)
  - Extracted table, list, and media handlers (2,528 lines)
  - Extracted semantic and form handlers (1,532 lines)
  - Improved code organization and maintainability across all language bindings
- **Unified FFI bindings architecture** - Consolidated common binding logic into shared crate, reducing duplication across Python, TypeScript, Ruby, PHP, Go, and Java bindings
- **Added visitor callback code generation system** - FFI now supports dynamic visitor callbacks for all language bindings (Python, Ruby, PHP, Elixir, etc.)
- **Enhanced preprocessing system** - Footer and nav element removal now integrated into preprocessing pipeline
- **Improved custom element detection** - Enhanced `has_custom_element_tags` to accurately detect only tag names with hyphens

### Internal

- Updated dependencies across all language bindings (Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Go, etc.)
- Refactored benchmark harness to modularize script adapters and reduce code duplication
- Refactored performance examples to extract and reuse shared utilities
- Improved sync_versions.py to handle all internal workspace dependency version pins
- Refactored README generation script to modularize template handling
- Improved clippy lint handling and CI coverage workflows
- Added documentation to Node.js binding example files

## [2.21.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- **`skip_images` configuration option** - New option to skip all `<img>` elements during conversion, enabling greater control over image handling in the output.
- **Optional visitor parameter across all convert functions** - Unified API for applying visitor patterns to all conversion modes:
  - `convert(html, options, visitor)` - Basic conversion with optional visitor
  - `convert_with_inline_images(html, options, image_cfg, visitor)` - Inline image extraction with optional visitor
  - `convert_with_metadata(html, options, metadata_cfg, visitor)` - Metadata extraction with optional visitor
- **Visitor pattern integration with advanced features** - Support for using visitor pattern simultaneously with inline images and metadata extraction, providing complete control over the conversion process.
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - Added tests validating `skip_images` functionality and visitor pattern integration across all conversion functions and language bindings.

### Changed

- **Visitor parameter unified across all APIs** - The visitor parameter is now optional on all conversion functions, enabling consistent API design across basic, inline-images, and metadata extraction paths.
- **Improved feature-gated architecture** - Refined the feature gate handling for better flexibility when combining visitor patterns with other optional features.

### Deprecated

- **`convert_with_visitor()` function** - Deprecated in favor of passing visitor as an optional parameter to `convert()`. The dedicated function will be removed in a future major release. Use `convert(html, options, visitor)` instead.

### Fixed

- **Unused dependency warnings in npm packages** - Resolved unused dependency warnings reported during builds of JavaScript/TypeScript packages.
- **Feature gate handling for visitor combinations** - Fixed issues with feature gate combinations when using visitor patterns alongside inline images and metadata extraction.

## [2.19.6] - 2026-01-03

### Bug Fixes

- **WASM npm package publishing**: Fixed Issue #172 - WASM package was published with only 3 files (LICENSE, package.json, README.md) instead of 25 files
  - Root cause: publish workflow downloaded WASM artifact tarballs but never extracted them before running `npm publish`
  - Added extraction step in `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` to unpack dist/, dist-node/, and dist-web/ directories
  - Added safeguard to remove .gitignore files from dist directories that could exclude content
  - Complete package now includes all WASM binaries and JavaScript wrappers (7.8 MB unpacked)

## [2.19.5] - 2025-01-02

### Bug Fixes

- **Homebrew bottle naming**: Fixed bottle filename format to match Homebrew convention
  - Changed from double-dash (`html-to-markdown--2.19.x`) to single-dash (`html-to-markdown-2.19.x`)
  - Homebrew constructs bottle URLs based on formula name and version, expecting single dash separator

## [2.19.4] - 2025-01-02

### Bug Fixes

- **Homebrew formula publishing**: Fixed publish workflow script that updates the Homebrew tap formula
  - Corrected bottle block deletion regex (was looking for `# bottle do` instead of `bottle do`), preventing duplicate bottle blocks from accumulating on each release
  - Added automatic source tarball SHA256 computation and formula update to ensure correct checksums
  - Formula now properly replaces old bottle blocks with new ones rather than appending

## [2.19.3] - 2025-01-02

### Bug Fixes

- **Table image processing**: Fixed Issue #175 - images inside Blogger-style HTML tables (e.g., `<table class="tr-caption-container">`) were being stripped during conversion. Enhanced table scanner to recognize images as content and properly process non-table elements like `<a>` and `<img>` that are direct children of table elements.
- **WASM npm package**: Fixed Issue #172 completely - package was published but missing all WASM binaries and JavaScript wrappers (only 23 KB with 3 files). Created `.npmignore` to include `dist/`, `dist-node/`, and `dist-web/` directories that were excluded by `.gitignore` during npm publish.
- **PHP Packagist publishing**: Fixed version mismatch that caused Packagist to reject v2.19.2 tag. Updated `sync_versions.py` to synchronize both root `composer.json` and `packages/php/composer.json`.
- **Test apps**: Fixed relative fixture paths in C#, Java, and Elixir test apps. Updated Elixir tests to handle tuple-returning API. Added Java native library path configuration.

### Infrastructure

- Enhanced `sync_versions.py` script to update root `composer.json` for Packagist validation
- Recreated v2.19.2 git tag with correct composer.json version

## [2.19.2] - 2025-12-30

### Bug Fixes

### Fixed
- Node benchmark harness now runs from the package directory and uses native bindings.
- Profiling stability fixes across Go, Elixir, Java, and WASM adapters.
- Binary input detection now flags compressed/magic signatures and UTF-16 data with clearer errors.

### Performance
- Rust core conversion: metadata extraction, inline image handling, tag/whitespace caches, and text assembly hot paths.
- Bindings interop: tighter metadata serialization/deserialization paths.
- Rust bench harness (local, Apple M4): median ops/sec improved 18.8× on Wikipedia fixtures (53.7 → 1009.1).

## [2.15.0] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed
- Rust core: clamp table `colspan`/`rowspan` to prevent pathological allocations on malformed HTML.
- Rust core: reject binary-like inputs early to avoid OOMs when non-HTML data is passed to `convert`.

## [2.14.11] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- C# (NuGet): fix `ConvertWithMetadata()` deserialization for metadata enums (`link_type`, `image_type`, `data_type`, `text_direction`) by honoring the JSON wire values.

## [2.14.10] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- Python: release the GIL during native conversion so `ThreadPoolExecutor` parallelism doesn't regress performance, and always build the extension with metadata support (so `convert_with_metadata` is always available).

## [2.14.9] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- Structured data: JSON-LD is now extracted from `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags (including when placed in `<head>`), preserving the script contents for parsing.

## [2.14.8] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- Rust crate (`html-to-markdown-rs`): enable the `metadata` feature by default so `convert_with_metadata` is available without extra Cargo features.

## [2.14.7] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- Elixir (macOS): package now ships a `.cargo/config.toml` so Rustler can compile without requiring user-specific linker flags.

## [2.14.6] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- RubyGems publish: skip duplicate `ruby`-platform gems when multiple CI jobs produce identical artifacts for the same version.
- Hex publish: ensure the Rust core crate is staged into the Elixir package before publishing.

## [2.14.5] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- RubyGems publish: prevent corrupted gem pushes by downloading `rubygems-*` artifacts into separate directories (no merge), and publishing gems recursively with an integrity check.

## [2.14.4] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- Release pipeline: build the C# `osx-x64` native FFI library on `macos-15-intel` (macOS-13 runners are retired), unblocking NuGet publication.
- Elixir (Hex): package now vendors the Rust core crate so `mix deps.get && mix test` works outside this monorepo.

## [2.14.3] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- **Issue #150 / Discord report**: Python now always exports `convert_with_metadata` (no more `ImportError` on import).
- **Issue #149**: Blockquote text now word-wraps when `wrap=true`.
- **FFI JSON parity**: Metadata enums now serialize as snake_case (e.g. `external`, `relative`) to match cross-language expectations.
- PHP test runner now always builds the extension with the `metadata` feature enabled (avoids missing `html_to_markdown_convert_with_metadata` when the workspace was built with `--no-default-features`).

### Added
- Elixir: `convert_with_metadata/3` + `MetadataConfig` backed by the Rust metadata extractor.

### Changed
- WASM: metadata bindings are enabled by default so the published npm package exports `convertWithMetadata`.
- C# publish pipeline: stage native `html_to_markdown_ffi` libraries into the NuGet package under `runtimes/*/native`.
- Go: module path now uses semantic import versioning (`.../packages/go/v2`), and docs/examples were updated accordingly.
- Java: add `.sdkmanrc` for Java 25 + Maven 4; keep `maven-source-plugin` on `3.3.1` because `4.0.0-beta-1` is not compatible with Maven `4.0.0-rc-4`.

## [2.14.2] - 2025-12-13

### Changed
- CI/release automation: extracted Maven installer logic into `scripts/common/install-maven-latest.sh` and applied repo-wide lint/format cleanups.

## [2.14.1] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed
- **Issue #147**: Word wrap now works correctly in list items when using the `-w`/`--wrap` flag. List items with long text are properly wrapped while preserving list structure and indentation for both ordered and unordered lists.
- **Issue #146**: `strip_tags` and `preserve_tags` options now correctly prevent `<meta>` and `<title>` tags from being extracted into YAML frontmatter when `extract_metadata` is enabled.
- **Issue #145**: `strip_newlines=true` no longer causes excessive whitespace around block elements. Structural whitespace is now properly normalized while still removing newlines within paragraph content.

## [2.14.0] - 2025-12-11

### Added
- **CLI Metadata Extraction**: New `--with-metadata` flag with JSON output support for extracting document metadata, headers, links, images, and structured data from HTML documents.

  - 23 comprehensive tests covering all metadata types
- **FFI Core API**: New `html_to_markdown_convert_with_metadata()` C function for language-agnostic metadata extraction.
  - JSON serialization for cross-language compatibility
  - Proper memory management and error handling
  - 17 comprehensive tests including memory safety tests

### Changed

  - Both markdown and metadata pointers now set to null on any error
  - Added comprehensive memory safety tests
- **CLI Flag Implementation**: Fixed `--extract-document` flag not being mapped to MetadataConfig.
  - Flag now correctly controls document metadata extraction
  - Added 9 new CLI tests for metadata flags
- **Java Type Safety**: Fixed metadata loss and silent failures from missing fields and string-based enums.
  - Added dimensions field to ImageMetadata (was missing, causing 50% metadata loss)
  - Changed linkType, imageType, textDirection from String to proper enum types
  - Fixed exception swallowing in getLastError() - now logs errors and returns descriptive messages
- **Python Default Values**: Fixed incorrect `max_structured_data_size` default (was 100KB, should be 1MB).
  - Now uses `DEFAULT_MAX_STRUCTURED_DATA_SIZE` constant from Rust core
- **Constants Extraction**: Eliminated DRY violations by extracting hardcoded magic numbers.
  - Added `DEFAULT_MAX_STRUCTURED_DATA_SIZE: usize = 1_000_000` constant in Rust core

## [2.13.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- Comprehensive metadata extraction API across all language bindings (Python, TypeScript, Ruby, PHP, WASM).
- New `convert_with_metadata()` function returning both markdown and extracted metadata in a single pass.
- Metadata extraction includes: document metadata (title, description, keywords, author, language, Open Graph, Twitter Card), header hierarchy (h1-h6 with IDs and nesting), link classification (internal/external/anchor/email/phone), image metadata with type detection (data URIs, inline SVGs, external, relative), and structured data (JSON-LD, Microdata, RDFa).
- Python: 51 comprehensive integration tests with full TypedDict type stubs and mypy validation.
- TypeScript: 14 vitest tests with auto-generated NAPI types, runtime feature detection via `hasMetadataSupport()`, and 600+ lines of documentation.
- Ruby: 40+ RSpec tests with complete RBS type signatures and comprehensive API documentation.
- PHP: 21 PHPUnit tests with PHPStan level max compliance and readonly Value Objects.
- WASM: Complete metadata extraction with serde_wasm_bindgen serialization and getter/setter configuration structs.

### Changed
- Enabled metadata feature by default in TypeScript and Ruby bindings for production npm packages and gems.
- Updated all language binding versions to 2.13.0 with synchronized version management.

### Fixed
- Ruby: Added missing wrapper method for `convert_with_metadata` and fixed redundant `?` symbols in RBS type annotations.
- TypeScript: Enabled metadata feature in default Cargo features to ensure npm packages include metadata functionality.
- WASM: Fixed 3 clippy style violations (Default trait implementation, unwrap_or_default usage, struct initialization pattern).

## [2.12.1] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed
- Escape literal `|` characters inside table cells while leaving pipes inside `<code>` and `<pre>` untouched to avoid rendering backslashes in code spans/blocks (fixes #140).
- Handle nested tables without double-escaping pipes and add regression coverage for table cells containing code spans/blocks and nested tables.
- Preserve link-only list items when word wrapping is enabled so nested link lists are not merged or reflowed (fixes #143); added regression fixtures for the reported table-of-contents sample.

### Changed
- Updated dependency locks/manifests to align with the 2.12.1 release.
- Downgraded Java Maven compiler/source plugins back to 3.x to keep CI builds compatible with Maven 3 runners.

## [2.12.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added
- WebAssembly bundler target now supports Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler, and modern bundlers that provide `WebAssembly.Module` instead of `WebAssembly.Instance`.
- Three new WASM usage examples demonstrating different deployment targets:
  - `examples/wasm-node`: Node.js example using dist-node target
  - `examples/wasm-rollup`: Browser example using dist-web target with Rollup
  - `examples/wasm-cloudflare`: Cloudflare Workers example using bundler target with Wrangler

### Changed
- WASM bundler entry point now detects and handles `WebAssembly.Module` instances, building the proper import namespace for wasm-bindgen glue functions.

## [2.11.4] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed
- Node/WASM bundles now post-process their generated JS files to import the shared `WasmConversionOptions` typedef and emit typed doc comments (including typed inline-image `attributes`), so no `any` annotations leak into the published `dist`, `dist-node`, `dist-web`, or docs bundles.

## [2.11.3] - 2025-12-08
### Fixed
- Prevent link-label truncation from splitting multi-byte characters, which previously triggered a `PanicException` in the Python bindings when processing long anchors (resolves #139) and add a regression test to keep the truncation logic safe.

## [2.11.2] - 2025-12-07
### Added
- Explicitly ship typing artefacts in every binding: npm packages export `.d.ts` files by default, Ruby gems now include `sig/**/*.rbs` even when building outside git, and the Python wheel bundles `_html_to_markdown.pyi` plus a `py.typed` marker for static type checkers.

### Fixed
- Cleaned up the Python API’s inline-image helper to avoid redundant casts flagged by `mypy --strict`.
- Tightened PHP docblocks and psalm/phpstan annotations so option arrays use strongly typed shapes instead of `array<string, mixed>`.
- Hardened the WASM, Node, and Python bindings so their `options` argument is fully typed end-to-end (no `any` escapes in `.d.ts` files or placeholder `Any` annotations).

## [2.11.1] - 2025-12-05
### Fixed
- Preserve indentation in `<pre><code>` blocks while safely dedenting whitespace across multibyte characters to avoid panics when leading spaces are non-ASCII; regression fixture added for issue #134. Thanks @bbeardsley for the contribution.

## [2.11.0] - 2025-12-04
### Added
- CLI `--url` flag with optional `--user-agent` override to fetch remote HTML directly, plus charset-aware decoding.
- New GitHub Pages deploy workflow to publish the `docs/` demo from `main`.
- Additional CLI integration tests covering URL fetching (including custom UA, legacy markup, frameset/noframes, cp1252 decoding).

### Changed
- Demo layout now keeps input/output panes equal height and responsive.
- Rust core handles body-like content accidentally nested in `<head>` more gracefully.

## [2.10.1] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- Normalize whitespace inside link labels (collapse newlines and extra spaces) so anchors with messy HTML do not emit multi-line `[]` text.
- Flatten block children inside `<a>` (e.g., headings/paragraphs nested in anchors) into a single Markdown link instead of duplicating content; regression tests added for the reported Arabic product card case.

### Changed
- Synced all workspace/package versions to 2.10.1 via `task sync-versions`.

## [2.10.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- Centralized panic guarding for all bindings (Python, Node, PHP, WASM, C FFI) using a shared Rust helper so panics surface as language-native errors instead of unwinding across FFI boundaries.
- C FFI now stores the last error per thread and exposes it via `html_to_markdown_last_error`, with panic and UTF-8/null input diagnostics.
- Ruby binding now uses the shared panic guard and emits consistent panic messages; specs cover panic interception across conversion entrypoints.

### Changed
- Wasmtime test harness initializes conversion options via struct literals to reduce clippy noise in CI.

### Fixed
- Rust coverage CI now forces `cargo-llvm-cov` reinstall to avoid cached binary conflicts on GitHub runners.
- PHP smoke tests use the Packagist package name `goldziher/html-to-markdown`, matching README install instructions.

## [2.9.3] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- **Version sync** – Bumped the entire workspace (Rust, Python, npm, Ruby, Elixir, Java, C#, Go) to 2.9.3 via `task sync-versions` to prep the next patch release.
- **Docs & install commands** – Pointed all Composer references to the published `goldziher/html-to-markdown` package and clarified npm usage to the shipped packages (`html-to-markdown-node` / `html-to-markdown-wasm`).

### Fixed
- **Go lint CI** – Replaced the invalid `go fmt -l` invocations with `gofmt -l` in the Taskfile so `task check`/CI lint runs complete successfully on Go 1.25.

## [2.9.2] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- **UTF-8 safety (Fix #127)** – Guarded whitespace trimming against mid-codepoint truncation, eliminating byte-boundary panics on multilingual documents; added fixture and regression test for the reported Ruby-path crash.
- **Image conversion (Fix #128)** – `<img>` elements with `width`/`height` now render as Markdown images instead of raw HTML; regression test covers inline-data URIs with dimensions.

## [2.9.1] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- **HTML repair fallback** – Minified or malformed pages now reparse via html5ever when inline/block nesting is broken, keeping content that previously vanished (e.g., SPA shells and Hacker News markup).
- **Link label recovery** – Anchor text fallback prefers child formatting or hrefs only when appropriate, preventing empty labels while keeping CommonMark empty-link semantics intact.

### Fixed
- **Layout tables to lists** – Headless tables with mixed column counts/spans or nested tables render as list rows instead of broken Markdown tables, restoring Hacker News output.
- **Issue 121 regressions** – Added fixtures/tests for the empty SPA and malformed Hacker News samples; both now produce full Markdown content without frontmatter noise.

## [2.9.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- **Elixir bindings** – New `html_to_markdown` Hex package built with Rustler, exposing the Rust core converter to Elixir with configurable options plus `convert/2` and `convert!/2`.
- **WASM runtime verification** – Added a Wasmtime-backed e2e suite (`e2e/wasm-wasmtime`) plus `task wasm:test:wasmtime` to compile the `html-to-markdown-wasm` artefact for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and execute it inside Wasmtime. CI now runs these tests to ensure the WASM package works outside the browser runtime.

### Changed
- **Astral `tl` parser** – The HTML parser dependency now points to the actively maintained `astral-tl` fork (still imported as `tl`) so comment parsing stays up to date with upstream fixes.
- **NuGet Package ID** – C# bindings now publish under `Goldziher.HtmlToMarkdown` to avoid clashing with an existing community package.
- **Wasmtime CI Coverage** – The Wasmtime e2e job now runs on Linux x64, Linux arm64, macOS, and Windows runners so every GitHub-hosted architecture executes the WASM tests.

### Fixed
- **PHP PIE source bundle** – Release packaging strips the Wasmtime e2e workspace from the staged `Cargo.toml`, fixing the “failed to load manifest” error in the publish workflow.
- **Horizontal rule rendering** – `<p>…</p><hr>` now emits a blank line before `---` while preserving blockquote spacing so the rule is never misinterpreted as a setext heading.
- **Empty HTML comments** – Zero-width `<!---->` comment nodes are normalized before parsing, so comment placeholders no longer cause the following content to disappear.

## [2.8.3] - 2025-11-15

### Changed
- **Deterministic uv installs** – Every `uv sync` invocation in CI and the Taskfile now runs with `--no-install-workspace`, ensuring Python dependencies are resolved without mutating editable installs before the subsequent build/test steps run.

### Fixed
- **NuGet Publishing** – Release automation now uses GitHub’s trusted publisher flow via `NuGet/login@v1` (OIDC → short-lived API key) before pushing artifacts, removing the dependency on long-lived secrets.
- **Hex Publishing** – The release workflow invokes `mix hex.publish --yes` from `packages/elixir`, with `ex_doc` bundled as a dev dependency so documentation generation works during release.

## [2.8.2] - 2025-11-15

### Changed
- **Unified Version Sync** – `scripts/sync_versions.py` now updates Elixir `@version` declarations, the C# `.csproj`, and the Java `pom.xml` (alongside every npm/pyproject/Gemfile manifest). `task sync-versions` bumps the entire multi-language stack to **2.8.2** in one shot.
- **CI / Release Toolchains** – GitHub Actions now installs Elixir dependencies ahead of Credo and runs on **Elixir 1.19 + OTP 28.1**, matching the README prerequisites and preventing per-job regex recompilation warnings.
- **Taskfile Coverage** – Added `elixir:update` plus full `java:{install,update,test,lint}` tasks so `task setup`, `task update`, `task test`, and `task lint` cover every published runtime (Go, C#, Elixir, Java) just like the CI workflows.

## [2.8.1] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **Release Pipeline** – Bumped all package manifests to v2.8.1 so the publish workflow can push fresh artifacts after the v2.8.0 smoke-test fixes (PyPI, npm, and RubyGems refuse re-uploads of the same version).

## [2.8.0] - 2025-11-15

### Added
- **Java, C#, and Go Bindings (First Release)** – First public release of official Java (JNA), C# (.NET), and Go (CGO) language bindings. All three are integrated into the unified `task bench:bindings` harness and ship with comprehensive performance data in their READMEs. C# leads at ~1.4k ops/sec (≈171 MB/s), Go at ~1.3k ops/sec (≈165 MB/s), and Java at ~1.0k ops/sec (≈126 MB/s) on the 129 KB Wikipedia lists fixture.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Preprocessing Disabled by Default** – HTML preprocessing is now disabled by default in the library API to prevent silent content loss. Previously, `<nav>`, `<form>`, and related elements (along with all their children) were dropped by default, causing important content inside these tags to be lost. Users who want preprocessing must now explicitly enable it via `PreprocessingOptions { enabled: true, ... }`. The CLI behavior is unchanged (preprocessing has always been opt-in with `--preprocess`).
- **Rust Toolchain Settings** – All crates (including the Ruby binding) now inherit `edition = "2024"` and `rust-version = "1.85"` from the workspace to keep toolchain configuration centralized.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow DRY** – Created 17 reusable composite actions (8 build actions + 9 smoke test actions) to eliminate ~267 lines of duplication between CI and publish workflows.
- **Toolchain Management** – Migrated to official GitHub Actions parameters for Ruby Bundler 2.7.2 and PHP Composer 2.9.1, removing manual installation scripts.

### Fixed
- **Windows PHP Extension Build** – Replaced php-windows-builder orchestration with direct `cargo build` matching ext-php-rs's proven approach, resolving LLVM 19 MMX header incompatibilities and Zend symbol linking errors.
- **Linux PHP Build** – Added php-config path capture and parameter passing to build-php-linux action, fixing "php-config executable not found" errors.
- **Ruby Linux Build** – Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux builds to match magnus best practices, preventing potential "strings.h not found" errors.
- **golangci-lint CI** – Split golangci-lint pre-commit hook into separate invocations for `packages/go` and `examples/go-smoke` modules, fixing "directory prefix does not contain main module" errors by running each check from within its Go module directory.
- **Windows Go CGO Smoke Test** – Documented MSVC/MinGW toolchain incompatibility and skip Windows Go smoke test with informative message, as Go CGO uses MinGW which cannot link against MSVC-compiled Rust FFI libraries.
- **Go Code Quality** – Removed redundant newline in `examples/go-smoke/main.go` fmt.Println call (detected by newly-working golangci-lint).

## [2.7.2] - 2025-11-12

### Fixed
- **Node/WASM Binding Regression** – HTML preprocessing no longer drops `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` wrappers when their classes resemble navigation chrome, so large Wikipedia fixtures once again emit full markdown (restoring the Vitest length/table expectations for Node bindings and keeping WASM conversions consistent).
- **Cloudflare WASM Initialization** – Bundler builds of `html-to-markdown-wasm` now expose `initWasm()`/`wasmReady` so edge runtimes that instantiate WebAssembly modules asynchronously (Cloudflare Workers, Vite dev servers, etc.) can await initialization before calling `convert()`, eliminating the `__wbindgen_start` runtime error.
- **Footer Retention (Fix #120)** – The Rust preprocessor keeps plain `<footer>` content unless the element carries explicit navigation hints (role/class/id). Python and Rust conversions once again preserve footer copy while still stripping true navigation footers such as `.site-footer` menus.
- **Release Smoke Coverage** – The publish workflow now downloads the built artifacts (Node, WASM, Python wheels, Ruby gems, PHP zips) and reruns the README smoke installs across Linux/macOS/Windows before any packages are uploaded, ensuring we're testing the exact bits we ship.

## [2.7.1] - 2025-11-12

### Added
- **Language-Specific Benchmarks** – Every binding README (Node, WASM, Python, Ruby, PHP, TypeScript) now publishes the latest `task bench:bindings` throughput numbers so runtime documentation stays aligned with the shared fixtures.
- **Examples/Smoke Suite** – Added `examples/{node,wasm,python,ruby,php,rust}-smoke` plus an overview README to exercise both the published artifacts and local builds before a release.

### Changed
- **Docs Accuracy** – Node/WASM READMEs now clearly reference the real npm packages (`html-to-markdown-node`, `html-to-markdown-wasm`) and provide correct import samples.
- **TypeScript README** – Highlights that the CLI wrapper inherits the native Node benchmarks.
- **Repository Hygiene** – `.gitignore` now drops `.venv/`, vendor directories, and nested `node_modules/` so smoke tests and language-specific toolchains don’t dirty the tree.
- **Ruby Build Metadata** – `extconf.rb` uses a relative path for the embedded Cargo crate and the crate’s `Cargo.toml` now declares explicit `edition`, `rust-version`, and dependency pins, allowing `gem install` outside the workspace.
- **Version Sync Script** – `scripts/sync_versions.py` updates every `html-to-markdown-rs` dependency pin (workspace root plus downstream crates) to keep cross-language releases in lockstep.

### Fixed
- **Smoke Test Coverage** – Verified Node, WASM, Python, Ruby (local gem), PHP (Composer path repo), and Rust installs; documented gaps where external registries still need to publish `goldziher/html-to-markdown` or `html-to-markdown` 2.7.1 before release.

## [2.7.0] - 2025-11-12

### Added
- **Zero-Copy Inline Images** – Node/N-API and WASM bindings now expose `convertInlineImagesBuffer` / `convertBytesWithInlineImages`, letting benchmark harnesses feed `Buffer`/`Uint8Array` data directly without creating intermediate JS strings.

### Changed
- **Rust Core Preprocessing** – HTML normalization (self-closing fixes, malformed `<` escaping, script/style stripping) now happens in a single streaming pass that hands owned buffers straight to `tl::parse_owned`, cutting multiple allocations from every conversion.
- **Benchmark Harness + Docs** – Re-ran the cross-language runtime suite after the Rust core optimizations and refreshed the README tables, keeping the published throughput numbers (Node/Python/Rust/WASM/PHP) in sync with `tools/runtime-bench/results/latest.json`.
- **Version Alignment** – Bumped every package (Rust crates, npm packages, PyPI distribution, Ruby gem, PHP extension, WASM bundle) to `2.7.0` via `task sync-versions`.

### Fixed
- **Ruby Benchmark Output** – The Ruby benchmark driver now emits JSON without relying on `json` native extensions, preventing `libruby` incompatibility errors during `task bench:bindings`.
- **Nested `<strong>` Normalization (Fix #111)** – The Rust converter now tracks when bold markup is already active, so nested `<b>`/`<strong>` combinations (including `<mark>`, `<summary>`, `<legend>`) no longer generate `****` artifacts (`<b>bo<b>ld</b>er</b>` correctly becomes `**bolder**`). The CommonMark harness documents the four spec examples that expect stacked markers and skips them accordingly.
- **Heading Whitespace (Fix #118)** – ATX/Setext headings swallow layout-only newlines and indentation inside `<h1>…<h6>` so pretty-printed HTML like `<h2>Heading\n  Text</h2>` renders as a single Markdown heading line.
- **Inline Whitespace Preservation** – Reworked the inline text pipeline so removing zero-width inline elements (e.g., `<input>`, `<script>`, empty `<b>`) no longer collapses surrounding spaces; fixtures like `test_chomp`, `test_form_with_inputs_inline_mode`, and checkbox/task-list rendering now match their expected double-space gaps.
- **DOCTYPE Handling (Fix #119)** – `<!DOCTYPE …>` declarations are stripped during preprocessing so they never leak as stray `PUBLIC…` text in the output, even when metadata extraction is enabled.

## [2.6.6] - 2025-11-10

### Changed
- **Ruby Gem Packaging** – Moved the `html-to-markdown-rb` crate under `packages/ruby/ext/html-to-markdown-rb/native` and pointed `extconf.rb` at that path so every published gem now contains the Cargo sources it needs to compile on install.
- **Documentation Consistency** – Updated the root, crate, and package READMEs to drop references to the unrelated `html-to-markdown` npm package and to consistently list our supported targets (Node, WASM, Python, Ruby, PHP, CLI).
- **Dependency Refresh** – Ran `task update` to upgrade Rust crates, npm packages, Bundler gems, Python requirements, and Composer dependencies across the monorepo.

### Fixed
- **Rust Clippy Lints** – Addressed `clippy::unnecessary-map-or` in the converter and hOCR table builder by using `.is_none_or`, keeping inline-image filtering and column pruning logic clear while allowing `cargo clippy -D warnings` to pass.
- **PIE Source Packaging** – `scripts/package_php_pie_source.sh` now copies `packages/ruby/.../native` into the temporary workspace so the Ruby crate exists when PIE builds the PHP extension.

## [2.6.3] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed
- **Release Pipeline** - Fixed missing `is_tag` output in publish workflow that caused all publishing jobs to be skipped
- **Node.js Package Dependencies** - Added missing `optionalDependencies` to html-to-markdown-node package.json to properly link platform-specific binaries
- **Version Management** - Created centralized version sync script (`scripts/sync_versions.py`) to maintain consistency across all package manifests (Rust, Node.js, Python, Ruby, WASM)
- **Cargo Workspace** - Aligned html-to-markdown-rb crate version (was 2.5.7) with workspace version

### Changed
- Added `task sync-versions` command to Taskfile for easy version synchronization across the monorepo

## [2.6.2] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed
- **Table Rowspan Support** - Fixed tables with rowspan cells to correctly duplicate cell content across spanned rows instead of showing empty cells (fixes #116)
- **Node.js Platform Package Publishing** - Fixed workflow to correctly move packed .tgz files to npm directory for publishing
- **Deprecation Warnings** - Updated CLI tests to use `CARGO_BIN_EXE` env var instead of deprecated `cargo_bin` method
- **Deprecation Warnings** - Replaced deprecated `criterion::black_box` with `std::hint::black_box` in benchmarks
- **Clippy Warnings** - Fixed field assignment warnings by using struct initialization with defaults

## [2.6.1] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed
- **Node.js Platform Packages** - Fixed publishing of platform-specific npm packages. The workflow now correctly packs npm directories into .tgz files before publishing, ensuring all platform bindings (linux-x64-gnu, darwin-arm64, win32-x64-msvc, etc.) are published to npm.
- **WASM Package Publishing** - Added proper WASM package publishing workflow to ensure html-to-markdown-wasm is published to npm registry.

## [2.6.0] - 2025-11-07

### Added
- **PHP Extension Support** - Official PHP extension (`goldziher/html-to-markdown`) providing native HTML to Markdown conversion for PHP 8.2+
  - Built with ext-php-rs for high-performance Rust-backed conversion
  - Supports both Thread-Safe (TS) and Non-Thread-Safe (NTS) builds
  - Available for Windows (x86, x64), Linux, and macOS
  - Distributed via PIE (PHP Installer for Extensions) source bundles
  - Prebuilt Windows binaries for PHP 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4
  - Comprehensive test suite with PHPUnit

### Changed
- Refactored PHP build variable names from `HTM2MD_*` to `HTMLTOMARKDOWN_*` for improved clarity in Makefile.frag and config.m4
- Bumped all package versions to 2.6.0 across Rust crates, npm packages, PyPI wheels, Ruby gem, and PHP extension

## [2.5.7] - 2025-11-03

### Added
- Publish Windows PHP extension binaries alongside the PIE source bundle during the release pipeline, enabling one-click installs on every platform.
- Build and archive the CLI binary for Linux (gnu & musl), macOS arm64, and Windows x86_64, plus ship prebuilt WASM bundles (dist/dist-node/dist-web) so every runtime gets first-class artifacts.

### Changed
- Renamed the PHP extension package to `goldziher/html-to-markdown`, moved the Composer metadata to the repository root, and refreshed the documentation/badges for every language target.
- Bumped every package (Rust crates, npm packages, PyPI wheels, Ruby gem, PHP extension) to version 2.5.7.
- Restored the Node.js N-API build matrix so macOS, Windows, and Linux binaries ship automatically with each npm release.

### Fixed
- Preserve ordered list numbering and indentation when list items render headings or HTML tables, so mixed block content stays under the correct bullet (fixes #107).

## [2.5.6] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- The Ruby gem now packages its own README at the gem root, so RubyGems renders the fully formatted documentation (benchmarks, configuration, CLI notes) without broken links.
- Documentation links: the Ruby README now surfaces GitHub resources (issues, changelog, live demo) alongside feature highlights.
- Bumped every package (Rust crates, npm, PyPI, Ruby gem) to version 2.5.6.

## [2.5.5] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- Synced documentation: the root README now links to every language guide, and the Ruby README highlights GitHub resources alongside feature docs.
- Gem packaging now reads the README directly for the RubyGems long description while keeping Rubocop happy on all Ruby sources.
- Bumped every package (Rust crates, npm, PyPI, Ruby gem) to version 2.5.5.

## [2.5.4] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- Polished the Ruby gem messaging and README with performance highlights, configuration examples, and CLI guidance to match other language docs.
- Bumped every package (Rust crates, npm, PyPI, Ruby gem) to version 2.5.4.

## [2.5.3] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- Publish Ruby gems as precompiled artifacts for Linux (x86_64), macOS (arm64 & x86_64), and Windows (x64) via a matrix GitHub Action, ensuring the CLI executable matches the target platform.
- Split the release workflow into prepare/build/publish stages so dry runs build artifacts without pushing, and trusted publishing now uploads every generated `.gem`.
- Hardened the gem preparation script to clear stale CLI binaries before copying in the platform-specific build output.
- Re-enabled the cross-language release workflow so crates.io, PyPI wheels/sdist, and both npm packages ship alongside the Ruby release.

## [2.5.2] - 2025-10-29

- Fix Ruby gem packaging to embed standalone Cargo manifest (no workspace inheritance) so installs compile out of tree successfully.
- Bump versions across Rust, Node, Python, and Ruby bindings.

## [2.5.1] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- Magnus-based Ruby gem (`html-to-markdown-rb`) with CLI proxy and comprehensive specs.

### Changed
- CI now includes Ruby coverage across macOS, Linux, and Windows, installing the appropriate toolchains (MSYS2 on Windows) for Magnus builds.
- Release workflow prepares the Ruby gem via trusted publishing alongside existing crates/npm packages.

### Fixed
- Bundler version pinned to 2.5.12 to support Ruby 3.2 CI environments.

## [2.5.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added

- **New `preserve_tags` option** - Preserve specific HTML tags in their original HTML form instead of converting them to Markdown. This is useful for complex elements like tables that may not convert well to Markdown. Fixes issue #95.
    - Accepts a list of tag names (e.g., `["table", "form"]`)
    - Preserves all attributes and nested content as HTML
    - Works independently of `strip_tags` - can use both options together
    - Available in all bindings: Rust, Python, Node.js, and WASM
    - Comprehensive test coverage in Rust, Python (pytest), and TypeScript (vitest)

### Changed

- **HTML preprocessing is now enabled by default** - The `PreprocessingOptions.enabled` default changed from `False` to `True` to ensure robust handling of malformed HTML. Users who want minimal preprocessing can explicitly set `enabled=False`.

### Fixed

- **Task list checkbox support** - Fixed sanitizer removing `<input type="checkbox">` elements when `remove_forms` is enabled (default). Checkboxes are now preserved during preprocessing to enable proper task list conversion (`- [x]` / `- [ ]`).
    - Added `input` tag to allowed tags in all sanitization presets (minimal, standard, aggressive)
    - Preserved `type` and `checked` attributes on input elements
    - Fixed pre-existing bug where task list checkboxes were silently removed
- **Data URI support for inline images** - Fixed sanitizer stripping `data:` URLs from image src attributes. Base64-encoded inline images (data URIs) are now preserved during preprocessing.
    - Added `data` to allowed URL schemes in all sanitization presets
    - Fixes `convert_with_inline_images` functionality for base64-encoded images
- **CDATA section handling** - Fixed test expectation for CDATA sections. CDATA sections are now correctly preserved as-is during HTML parsing instead of being partially stripped.
- **hOCR word spacing** - Fixed missing whitespace between `<span class="ocrx_word">` elements in hOCR documents. Words now have proper spaces between them.
    - Modified `OcrxWord` converter to insert space before each word if output doesn't end with whitespace or markdown formatting characters
    - Ensures proper word separation in OCR-generated documents without breaking markdown formatting (e.g., `*text*`, `[alt](url)`, `` `code` ``)
- **hOCR detection with preprocessing** - Fixed hOCR documents not being detected when HTML preprocessing is enabled (new default). The sanitizer now preserves:
    - `class` attributes on all elements (required for detecting hOCR element types)
    - `<meta>` tags with `name` and `content` attributes (required for hOCR metadata detection)
    - `<head>` tags (container for meta tags)
- **hOCR metadata extraction after sanitization** - Fixed metadata extraction failing when preprocessing strips the `<head>` container element. The extractor now finds orphaned meta tags anywhere in the document, not just inside `<head>` elements.
- **`preserve_tags` functionality with preprocessing** - Fixed `preserve_tags` not working when HTML preprocessing is enabled (the new default). The sanitizer now:
    - Accepts the `preserve_tags` list and allows those tags through sanitization
    - Preserves common HTML attributes (`id`, `class`, `style`, `title`, etc.) on preserved tags
    - Prevents `remove_forms` from stripping form tags when they're in the preserve list
    - Ensures tags and attributes survive preprocessing so they can be output as HTML
- **SVG support for inline image extraction** - Fixed SVG elements being stripped by the sanitizer, breaking inline image capture. All sanitization presets now allow:
    - SVG elements: `svg`, `circle`, `rect`, `path`, `line`, `polyline`, `polygon`, `ellipse`, `g`
    - SVG attributes: `width`, `height`, `viewBox`, `cx`, `cy`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `d`, `fill`, `stroke`
    - Enables `convert_with_inline_images` to capture inline SVG elements
- **Robust handling of malformed angle brackets in HTML** - Fixed parser failures when bare `<` or `>` characters appear in HTML text content (e.g., `1<2`, mathematical comparisons). The converter now:
    - Automatically escapes malformed angle brackets that aren't part of valid HTML tags
    - Works correctly with preprocessing both enabled and disabled
    - Handles edge cases like `1<2`, `1 < 2 < 3`, and angle brackets at tag boundaries
    - Fixes issue #94 where content following malformed angle brackets was lost
- Added comprehensive test coverage for malformed angle bracket handling in both Rust and Python test suites
- Fixed WASM build configuration to use correct `getrandom` backend for wasm32-unknown-unknown targets

## [2.4.1] - 2025-10-22

### Fixed

- Ensure npm publishes include the generated Node bindings and platform binaries by running the N-API build during CI.
- Configure WebAssembly builds with the `wasm_js` backend and strip wasm-pack `.gitignore` files so published packages ship the compiled `.wasm` artifacts.

## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-22

### Changed

- Updated Rust workspace dependencies (including `pyo3`) to their latest compatible releases and refreshed lockfiles.
- Normalized hOCR conversion spacing by collapsing stray triple newlines, ensuring generated Markdown matches regression fixtures.

### Fixed

- Corrected the WASM crate to depend on `getrandom`'s `wasm_js` feature, restoring WebAssembly builds.
- Expanded the Node package `files` list so published tarballs now include compiled `.node` artifacts, CommonJS shims, and typings.

## [2.3.4] - 2025-10-12

### Changed

- Incremented all distribution metadata and CLI version checks to 2.3.4 following the previous release tag conflict.
- Regenerated package metadata artifacts for the new patch release.

## [2.3.3] - 2025-10-12

### Added

- Python API now exports inline image helpers (`InlineImage`, `InlineImageWarning`, and `InlineImageConfig`) alongside `convert_with_inline_images`, with dedicated regression tests.
- Node and WASM bindings include inline image extraction examples and TypeScript definitions, validated by Vitest coverage.

### Changed

- Bumped all package metadata (Python, Rust, Node, WASM, CLI) to version 2.3.3 for a synchronized release.

### Fixed

- CLI `--version` test updated to assert the new release number.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added

- `hocr_spatial_tables` option on `ConversionOptions` (Rust, Python, CLI) with `--no-hocr-spatial-tables` flag to disable spatial table reconstruction when desired.
- New hOCR regression fixtures for complex tables and code blocks to guard against formatting regressions.

### Changed

- Improved hOCR conversion heuristics to distinguish between dense paragraph layouts and true tables, yielding cleaner Markdown for scientific data.
- hOCR code-block detection now preserves fenced formatting, restoring context headings when present.

### Fixed

- CLI `--version` output and package metadata now report version 2.2.0 consistently.

## [2.1.1] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed

- Improve hOCR table reconstruction when tables are represented as paragraphs, ensuring Markdown tables are emitted for Tesseract outputs without explicit `ocr_table` markers.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added

- **Inline image extraction** - New `convert_with_inline_images()` function to extract embedded images during conversion
    - Supports data URI images (`data:image/*`)
    - Supports inline SVG elements
    - Configurable via `InlineImageConfig` with options for:
        - Maximum decoded size limits
        - Custom filename prefixes
        - SVG capture control
        - Optional dimension inference for raster images
    - Returns `HtmlExtraction` with markdown, extracted images, and warnings
    - Available through both Rust and Python APIs

### Changed

- **Simplified API** - Removed `ParsingOptions` class in favor of direct `encoding` parameter on `ConversionOptions`
- **Automatic hOCR table extraction** - hOCR tables are now extracted automatically without requiring configuration
    - Removed `hocr_extract_tables` option (always enabled for hOCR content)
    - Removed `hocr_table_column_threshold` option (uses built-in heuristics)
    - Removed `hocr_table_row_threshold_ratio` option (uses built-in heuristics)
- Updated pre-commit hook versions (commitlint v9.23.0, pyproject-fmt v2.10.0, ruff v0.14.0)

### Fixed

- **hOCR metadata now uses YAML frontmatter** instead of HTML comments for cleaner markdown output
- **hOCR code organization** - Restructured spatial table reconstruction into dedicated `hocr/spatial.rs` module
- **Conservative table detection** - hOCR spatial table reconstruction now only applies to explicit `ocr_table` elements, preventing false positives
- Windows CLI binary detection - now correctly searches for `.exe` extension on Windows
- CLI binary bundling in Python wheels - binary now included in package for all platforms
- hOCR extractor Rust doctest - added missing import statement
- 928 Python test expectations updated for CommonMark-compliant v2 defaults
- Python 3.14-dev → Python 3.14 stable in CI workflows

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-03

### 🚀 Major Rewrite: Rust Backend

Version 2.0.0 represents a complete rewrite of html-to-markdown with a high-performance Rust backend, delivering **10-30x performance improvements** while maintaining full backward compatibility through a v1 compatibility layer.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

#### CommonMark-Compliant Defaults

V2 adopts CommonMark-compliant defaults for better interoperability:

| Option                  | V1 Default   | V2 Default | Reason                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `list_indent_width`     | 4            | 2          | CommonMark standard              |
| `bullets`               | "-"          | "\*+-"     | Cycling bullets for nested lists |
| `escape_asterisks`      | true         | false      | Minimal escaping                 |
| `escape_underscores`    | true         | false      | Minimal escaping                 |
| `escape_misc`           | true         | false      | Minimal escaping                 |
| `newline_style`         | "backslash"  | "spaces"   | CommonMark two-space line breaks |
| `code_block_style`      | "backticks"  | "indented" | CommonMark 4-space indent        |
| `heading_style`         | "underlined" | "atx"      | CommonMark `#` headings          |
| `preprocessing.enabled` | false        | false      | No change (opt-in)               |

**Migration**: If you relied on v1 defaults, explicitly set options to match v1 behavior.

#### Removed CLI Flags

The following v1 CLI flags are **not supported** in v2. The Python CLI proxy will raise helpful error messages when these flags are used:

| Removed Flag | Reason                | Migration                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `--strip`    | Feature removed in v2 | Remove flag (feature no longer available) |
| `--convert`  | Feature removed in v2 | Remove flag (feature no longer available) |

**Note on Redundant Flags**: The following v1 flags are redundant in v2 (they match the defaults) but are **silently accepted** for backward compatibility:

- `--no-escape-asterisks`, `--no-escape-underscores`, `--no-escape-misc` (v2 defaults to minimal escaping)
- `--no-wrap` (v2 defaults to no wrapping)
- `--no-autolinks` (Rust CLI defaults to no autolinks)
- `--no-extract-metadata` (Rust CLI defaults to no metadata extraction)

These flags can be safely removed from your commands, or you can leave them for compatibility.

**Note**: The Rust CLI only supports positive flags (e.g., `--escape-asterisks`, `--autolinks`, `--wrap`). Negative flags (`--no-*`) are only supported through the Python CLI proxy for v1 compatibility.

#### CommonMark-Compliant List Formatting

- **Tight lists no longer have blank lines before nested sublists** - This follows the [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/) for list formatting
- Previous behavior (v1): `* Item 1\n\n    + Nested\n`
- New behavior (v2): `* Item 1\n    + Nested\n`
- **Why**: CommonMark specifies that tight lists (lists without blank lines between items) should not have blank lines before nested sublists
- **Impact**: Generated markdown will render identically in CommonMark-compliant renderers but may look different in source form
- **Migration**: If you need the old behavior for specific platforms, you can post-process the output or use loose lists (with blank lines between items)

### Added

#### Core Rust Implementation

- **Complete Rust rewrite** of HTML-to-Markdown conversion engine using `scraper` and `html5ever`
- **Native Rust CLI** with improved argument parsing and validation
- **PyO3 Python bindings** for seamless Rust/Python integration
- **Automatic hOCR table extraction** with built-in heuristics for OCR documents

#### New V2 API

- Clean, modern API with dataclass-based configuration
- `convert(html, options, preprocessing)` - primary API entry point
- `ConversionOptions` - comprehensive conversion settings (now includes `encoding`)
- `PreprocessingOptions` - HTML cleaning configuration
- Legacy parsing options removed in favour of explicit encoding on `ConversionOptions`
- Improved type safety with full type stubs (`.pyi` files)

#### V1 Compatibility Layer

- **100% backward compatible** v1 API through compatibility layer
- `convert_to_markdown()` function with all v1 kwargs
- Smart translation of v1 options to v2 dataclasses
- CLI argument translation for v1 flags
- Clear error messages for unsupported v1 features

#### Testing & Quality

- **77 new tests** for v1 compatibility (32 bindings + 26 CLI + 19 integration)
- Comprehensive integration tests with actual CLI execution
- Wheel testing workflow for cross-platform validation
- Python 3.10, 3.12, 3.14-dev test matrix
- Dual coverage reporting (Python + Rust)

#### CI/CD Improvements

- Shared build-wheels action for consistent wheel building
- Test-wheels workflow with full test suite on built wheels
- Rust coverage with `cargo-llvm-cov`
- Python coverage in LCOV format
- Automated wheel building for Python 3.10-3.13

### Changed

#### Performance

- **60-80x faster** than v1 for most conversion operations (144-208 MB/s throughput)
- Memory-efficient processing with Rust's zero-cost abstractions
- Optimized table handling with rowspan/colspan tracking
- Faster list processing with unified helpers

#### Architecture

- Removed Python implementation (`converters.py`, `processing.py`, `preprocessor.py`)
- Migrated to Rust-based conversion engine
- Simplified Python layer to thin wrapper around Rust bindings
- CLI now proxies to native Rust binary with argument translation

#### API Design

- More explicit configuration with separate option classes
- Better separation of concerns (conversion/preprocessing/parsing)
- Clearer parameter naming and organization
- Improved error messages and exception handling

### Removed v1 Features

The following v1 features were **removed** in v2:

- `code_language_callback` - Removed (use `code_language` option for default language)
- `strip` option - Removed (use preprocessing options instead)
- `convert` option - Removed (all supported tags are converted by default)
- `convert_to_markdown_stream()` - Removed (html5ever does not support streaming parsing)

### Not Yet Implemented

- `custom_converters` - Planned for future release with Rust and Python callback support

### Migration Guide

#### For Most Users (No Changes Needed)

If you're using the v1 API, your code will continue to work:

```python
from html_to_markdown import convert_to_markdown

# This still works in v2!
markdown = convert_to_markdown(html, heading_style="atx")
```

#### To Use New V2 API (Recommended)

```python
from html_to_markdown import convert, ConversionOptions

options = ConversionOptions(heading_style="atx")
markdown = convert(html, options)
```

#### CLI Changes

V1 CLI flags are automatically translated to v2:

```bash
# V1 style (still works)
html-to-markdown --preprocess-html --escape-asterisks input.html

# V2 style (recommended)
html-to-markdown --preprocess input.html  # escaping is default
```

### Performance Benchmarks

Real-world performance improvements over v1 (Apple M4):

| Document Type       | Size  | V2 Latency | V2 Throughput | Speedup vs V1 (2.5 MB/s) |
| ------------------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Lists (Timeline)    | 129KB | 0.62ms     | 208 MB/s      | **83x**                  |
| Tables (Countries)  | 360KB | 2.02ms     | 178 MB/s      | **71x**                  |
| Mixed (Python wiki) | 656KB | 4.56ms     | 144 MB/s      | **58x**                  |

V2's Rust engine delivers **60-80x higher throughput** than V1's Python/BeautifulSoup implementation across real-world documents.

| **Dependencies** | bs4, lxml, soupsieve       | None (statically linked) |

#### Output Differences (Default Settings)

| HTML                     | V1 Output                | V2 Output           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `<ul><li>Item</li></ul>` | `*   Item` (4 spaces)    | `- Item` (2 spaces) |
| `<h1>Title</h1>`         | `Title\n=====`           | `# Title`           |
| `Text*with*stars`        | `Text\*with\*stars`      | `Text*with*stars`   |
| `<br>`                   | Two trailing spaces      | Backslash `\`       |
| `<pre>code</pre>`        | ```` ```\ncode\n``` ```` | Indented 4 spaces   |

These differences reflect v2's alignment with CommonMark specification.
